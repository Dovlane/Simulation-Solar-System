# Simulation-Solar-System - about project

In this program, I've successfully imported all the key parameters from the real Solar System:
1. The distances of planets relative to the Sun.
2. The gravitational constant's value.
3. The masses of celestial bodies.
4. The velocities of planets orbiting the Sun relative to the Sun.
5. The angle of rotation axis of planets relative to the ecliptic plane along with their rotational velocity around their axis.

I've adhered to the principles of classical physics, respecting gravitational interactions between all bodies.
However, I've neglected one "less crucial" parameter, which is the size of their radii. To enhance visibility, I've increased the radius of each celestial body by 40 times. Without this adjustment, they wouldn't be discernible to the naked eye.
The simulation provides six speed options that can be adjusted using a slider, with each option representing a different time scale relative to one second of simulation:
1. 1 real second
2. 1 real minute
3. 1 real hour 
4. 1 real day
5. 1 real week
6. 1 real month 

Additionally, there are radio buttons providing two functionalities:
1. Focus on object: This centers one celestial body in the frame, keeping it stationary while the others orbit around it.
2. Make a trail: This prompts the selected object to leave a trail, facilitating the examination of its movement.

For both options, we select the desired object from a dropdown menu to apply the chosen functionality.

# How to use

To adjust focus, use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and out. To change the viewing angle, hold down the right mouse button while moving the mouse.
For instance, if you wish to observe the Moon's rotation around the Earth, you can make full use of the tools provided by this program.
Here's how to get started:
1. At the bottom left corner, you'll find a radio button labeled "Focus on object." Click on it (it's usually selected by default). Initially, the focus is default, centered at the (0, 0, 0) coordinate of the environment itself.
2. To shift the focus to Earth, navigate to the dropdown menu (located to the right of this radio button) and select the "Earth" option. After selecting it, the display should change accordingly.

3. Now, to observe the Earth's rotation, let's increase the simulation speed. Move the slider two positions to the right – notice how it slows down? This is because each second of simulation now corresponds to 15 degrees of Earth's rotation around its axis! If you'd like to accelerate further, move the slider one more position to the right.
4. With the simulation now at a suitable speed, let's direct our attention to the Moon! If you wish to track the Moon's trajectory, first choose the "Make a trail" option. Then, in the dropdown menu where you previously selected "Earth," now choose "Moon."
5. Lastly, if you want to make the Moon's rotation around the Earth more noticeable, speed up the simulation a bit more.
